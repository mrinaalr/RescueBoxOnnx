# UFDR-Mounter

A Python-based FUSE virtual filesystem that allows you to mount `.ufdr` and `.zip` archives as read-only directories. This tool lets you browse the contents of forensic archives (like Cellebrite UFDR exports) without extracting them.

Made for integration with RescueBox (UMass Amherst Â· Spring 2025).


# UFDR
