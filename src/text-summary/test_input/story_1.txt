The Adventure of Tilly the Tiny Turtle

Once upon a time, in a sunny little pond at the edge of a forest, lived a tiny turtle named Tilly. Tilly had a shiny green shell and big curious eyes. More than anything, Tilly loved to explore.

One morning, Tilly peeked out from her shell and stretched her legs. "Today," she said, "I'm going on an adventure!"

She waved goodbye to her frog friend, Freddy, and waddled out of the pond.

As she wandered through the tall grass, Tilly met Bella the Butterfly.
"Hello, Bella!" said Tilly. "I'm going on an adventure. Want to come?"
"I’d love to!" said Bella, fluttering her wings.

Together, they crossed over a fallen log and climbed a small hill. At the top, they saw something shiny. It was a little stream!

"I’ve never seen a stream before!" said Tilly.

Suddenly, they heard a rustle. Out popped Benny the Bunny.
"Hello!" he said. "Are you exploring too?"

"Yes!" giggled Tilly. "We’re on an adventure. Want to come?"

And so the three new friends followed the stream, finding pretty pebbles and tiny fish swimming by.

When the sun began to set, Tilly looked around.
"I think it's time to go home," she said.

Bella fluttered up high to show the way, and Benny bounced beside Tilly to keep her company.

Back at the pond, Freddy the Frog was waiting.
"How was your adventure?" he asked.

"It was amazing!" said Tilly. "And I made new friends too!"

From that day on, Tilly, Bella, and Benny went on many more adventures—but they always made it home before the stars came out.

The End.
